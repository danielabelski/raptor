"""ZKPoX Tier 1.5 — native reproduction.

The strongest claim achievable *without* the heavy ZK stack: take
a bundle's witness, run it against the target N times in the
sandbox, and confirm the recorded outcome reproduces every time.
"Verified-reproducible exploit" — not zero-knowledge, but
empirically solid.

**On request** in the trigger model: N× sandbox execution is real
cost + a policy shift (running code repeatedly), so it never fires
automatically — the operator asks for it.

Reproduction is source-dispatched, because "re-run the witness"
means different things depending on what the witness *is*:

  * ``LLM_EMIT_RUN`` — the witness bytes are exploit *source code*.
    Reproduce = recompile + run, N times, via
    ``exploit_verify.compile_and_execute``. Self-contained for the
    inline-trigger PoCs the crash-analysis prompt now produces. If
    the recorded outcome is a sanitizer report, the recompile uses
    the matching ``-fsanitize`` flag so ASAN can fire again.

  * ``FUZZ`` / other input-replay sources — the witness bytes are
    *input* to a target binary. Reproduce = feed the bytes to the
    binary's stdin N times, mapping each run through
    ``core.witness.outcome_from_sandbox_info``. Needs the actual
    target binary supplied by the caller (the store holds only its
    hash); we verify the supplied binary's sha256 matches the
    bundle's ``target_binary_hash`` before trusting the result.

**Spawn failures are not outcomes.** A run whose child never
successfully exec'd the target (exec-status category from the sandbox,
the supervisor's ``spawn_failed`` record on the recompile lane, or the
bounded 125/126/127-with-no-output shape) is recorded in
``run_details`` with provenance ``spawn_failure``, retried once, and
excluded from the reproduced/deterministic verdict — counting it would
let a transient ETXTBSY read as "non-deterministic witness". The
bounded shape applies on EVERY lane, including the exec-status-pipe
one: the pipe reports failure best-effort only, so its silence never
vetoes the heuristic. See :func:`_spawn_failure_reason` for the
precise-vs-heuristic split and its bounds.

The full tier model lives in the package docstring
(``packages/zkpox/__init__.py``).

    outcome).

    Precise signal first: results from the exec-status-pipe lanes
    (mount-ns spawn path, macOS seatbelt shim) carry ``_setup_status``.
    Any category tuple means setup or exec failed before the target
    ran — authoritative, no heuristic needed.

    ``_setup_status`` ``None`` (pipe EOF) is authoritative only in the
    POSITIVE direction. EOF normally means the target exec'd (CLOEXEC
    reaped the write end), but the channel is best-effort at reporting
    failure: the child-side write runs suppressed in a dying process
    and the parent-side drain maps an unreadable pipe to the same
    ``None`` — so a lost status byte is indistinguishable from a clean
    exec. A spawn-lane replay run has been observed exiting 126 with
    pipe EOF, no output, and no crash evidence; counting it as an
    outcome flipped a deterministic SIGSEGV witness to
    "non-deterministic". Silence therefore never vetoes the bounded
    heuristic below — only a category tuple short-circuits.

    The heuristic (status ``None`` or attribute absent — the pid1-shim
    subprocess lane, the Landlock-only retry, plain subprocess
    fallbacks — where exec failure is re-encoded as exit 125/126/127
    with no side channel): a bare 125-127 exit is ambiguous with a
    target that chooses those codes, so the reclassification is
    bounded to the pre-first-output window. A failed exec happens
    before the target's first instruction, so the child writes NOTHING
    except (possibly) the sandbox layer's own diagnostics
    (see :func:`_stderr_is_sandbox_diagnostic_only`); any
    signal/sanitizer evidence or any target output disqualifies the
    reclassification. The residual ambiguity — a target that exits
    125-127 without ever producing output — costs one bounded retry
    and, when persistent, an honest "runs did not execute"
    non-reproduction, never a false "reproduced". No new forgery power
    either: a target that wants to dodge reproduction can already just
    exit 0.

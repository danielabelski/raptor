"""Adversarial size concretization for symbolic-length libc calls.

A copy/read whose LENGTH is attacker data (``memcpy(dst, src,
hdr[1])`` — the classic declared-length overflow) makes angr build a
per-byte conditional expression over every possible length. The
resulting AST wedges z3 at ASSERT time, which the solver ``timeout``
parameter does not bound (it only caps check-sat) — the isolate's
hard kill is the only thing that stops it, and the solve is lost.

The escape is to never build that expression: at the SimProcedure
boundary, a symbolic size argument is constrained to its MAXIMUM
satisfiable value (capped). For overflow verification the maximum is
exactly the adversarial choice — the attacker supplying the length
picks the largest the path admits. The cost is completeness, not
soundness: a witness found under the max-length constraint is a real
witness (the constraint only narrows the state); a hijack reachable
only at some mid-range length is missed, which the honest
"no witness" result already covers.

Hooks are installed on the angr project INSIDE the isolated solve
child (each solve runs in its own spawned process), so the shared
per-process project cache never leaks hooked state to other
consumers.

"""Threshold-free ranking metrics for precision harnesses.

Home for dependency-free score-vs-label primitives shared by the
measurement harnesses (``binary_oracle_precision``,
``sanitizer_cut_precision``, corpus drivers). These evaluate how well a
scalar score *ranks* positives above negatives without committing to a
threshold, which is the right question when comparing candidate metrics
head-to-head.

    ``scored`` is a sequence of ``(score, is_positive)`` pairs. The
    result is P(a uniformly random positive outranks a uniformly random
    negative), with ties counted half — 0.5 is chance, 1.0 is perfect
    separation, 0.0 is perfectly inverted. Returns ``None`` when either
    class is empty (AUC is undefined, not zero).

    Tie-aware: tied scores receive their average rank, so a constant
    score yields exactly 0.5 rather than an order-dependent artefact.
    Dependency-free by design — no NumPy/SciPy.

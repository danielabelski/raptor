"""Package-level test infra for everything under ``core/llm``.

The egress-reset fixture lived only in ``core/llm/tests/conftest.py``,
which does NOT cover the sibling test trees
(``dispatcher/tests``, ``scorecard/tests``, ``tool_use/tests``) — a
real-LLMClient constructor added to any of them would re-open the
proxy-env leak the audit conftest closed elsewhere. Hoisting the
wrapper to the package root covers every subtree.

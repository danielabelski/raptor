"""Regression tests for the proxy-events.jsonl target-pollution fix.

Some callers (notably packages/codeql/build_detector.py) intentionally
pass output=target so Landlock engages on a writable repo for compile/
build steps. The post-sandbox proxy-events.jsonl writer must NOT drop
its file into the user's scanned source tree in that scenario, but it
MUST keep writing when output is genuinely outside target. The
in-memory proxy_events on result.sandbox_info are unaffected either
way.

These run a real sandbox + egress proxy (same shape as the existing
TestE2EEgressProxy / TestPostSandboxParentTOCTOU tests).
